# Phase 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Reimbursement System - COMPLETE

## Overview
Phase 4 has been successfully completed with comprehensive RBAC implementation and a fully functional reimbursement request system integrated into the fraternity treasurer application.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced RBAC System (`rbac.py`)
- **Comprehensive Permission Structure**: Defined granular permissions for all roles
  - Treasurer: Full admin access, view/edit all data, approve requests, manage budgets
  - President: Read-only access to all treasurer data  
  - Vice President: View all budgets, edit specific categories (Social, Brotherhood, Recruitment, Phi ED)
  - Officers (Chair roles): Manage own budget category, submit reimbursements, create spending plans
  - Brothers: View personal dues/payments, suggest payment plans, basic fraternity info

- **Permission System Features**:
  - `has_permission()` - Check specific permissions
  - `@permission_required()` - Decorator for route protection
  - `get_user_permissions()` - Get all permissions for user
  - Context processor for template access

### 2. Role-Specific Dashboard Templates
Created personalized dashboards for each role:

- **`brother.html`**: Personal dues tracking, payment history, payment schedule, quick actions
- **`officer.html`**: Budget management dashboard with Chart.js visualization, spending overview
- **`treasurer.html`**: Full admin dashboard with financial overview and system stats  
- **`vp.html`**: Budget overview with category breakdown and system status

### 3. Reimbursement Request System (`reimbursement.py`)
Complete workflow for expense reimbursements:

#### Backend Features:
- **Request Submission**: Officers can submit reimbursement requests with receipts
- **File Upload**: Secure receipt attachment (PDF, images up to 5MB)
- **Budget Validation**: Ensures users can only submit for assigned categories
- **Approval Workflow**: Treasurer can approve/reject with reasons
- **Status Tracking**: Pending, approved, rejected states with timestamps

#### Frontend Templates:
- **`create.html`**: Interactive form with budget validation, file upload, client-side validation
- **`admin_list.html`**: Treasurer view with tabbed filtering, approve/reject modals
- **`officer_list.html`**: Officer personal request tracking with status cards
- **`member_list.html`**: Basic member request view
- **`request_table.html`**: Reusable table partial for consistent display

#### Key Routes:
- `/reimbursements` - List requests (role-based filtering)
- `/reimbursements/new` - Submit new request  
- `/reimbursements/<id>` - View request details
- `/reimbursements/<id>/approve` - Approve request (JSON API)
- `/reimbursements/<id>/reject` - Reject request (JSON API)
- `/reimbursements/<id>/receipt` - View receipt file
- `/reimbursements/summary` - Admin summary dashboard

### 4. Main Application Integration (`app_new.py`)
- **Blueprint Registration**: Integrated reimbursement blueprint
- **RBAC Integration**: Updated all dashboard routes with permission decorators
- **Context Processors**: Added RBAC functions to template context
- **Role-Based Routing**: Automatic dashboard routing based on user's primary role

### 5. Database Integration
- **Budget Categories**: Created sample budget data for testing
- **Current Semester**: Set up Fall 2024 semester as active
- **Model Alignment**: Updated code to work with existing model structure

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Permission System Architecture
```python
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    'treasurer': {
        'view_all_data': True,
        'approve_reimbursements': True,
        'manage_budgets': True,
        # ... comprehensive permissions
    },
    'social_chair': {
        'manage_own_budget': True,
        'submit_reimbursement': True,
        'view_social_budget': True,
        # ... role-specific permissions  
    }
}
```

### Reimbursement Workflow
1. **Officer Submission**: Select budget category â†’ Enter details â†’ Upload receipt â†’ Submit
2. **Treasurer Review**: View all requests â†’ Review details/receipts â†’ Approve or reject
3. **Status Updates**: Automatic notifications, transaction creation upon approval
4. **Budget Tracking**: Integration with budget limits and spending tracking

### Security Features
- **Role-based access control** for all routes
- **Permission validation** before data access
- **File upload security** with type/size validation
- **User isolation** - users can only see own requests unless admin
- **CSRF protection** through Flask forms

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

### System Status
- âœ… **Import Test**: All modules import successfully
- âœ… **Server Start**: Application runs without errors
- âœ… **Database Setup**: Budget categories and semester data created
- âœ… **Treasurer Account**: Login ready (+1234567890 / admin123)

### Ready for Testing
The system is now ready for comprehensive testing:
1. **Login as treasurer** to access admin features
2. **Navigate to `/reimbursements`** to see admin interface
3. **Test reimbursement submission** workflow
4. **Verify role-based access** on different dashboards
5. **Test approval/rejection** workflow with modals
