## 🗄️ **New Database Schema**

### **Core Tables Created:**
1. **`users`** - Authentication and role management
2. **`roles`** - Role definitions with permissions
3. **`user_roles`** - Many-to-many role assignments  
4. **`semesters`** - Term management with archiving
5. **`members`** - Enhanced member records (can link to users)
6. **`payments`** - Individual payment tracking
7. **`transactions`** - Financial transaction records
8. **`budget_limits`** - Per-semester budget management

### **New Workflow Tables:**
9. **`payment_plan_suggestions`** - Brother → Treasurer approval workflow
10. **`reimbursement_requests`** - Officer → Treasurer request system
11. **`spending_plans`** - Officer semester planning with versions
12. **`treasurer_config`** - System configuration settings

## 🔧 **Development Tools Created**

### **1. Migration Script** (`migrate_data.py`)
- Safely imports existing JSON data
- Creates automatic backups
- Handles data type conversions
- Preserves all existing relationships

### **2. Database Manager** (`database.py`)
- Check database status: `python3 database.py status`
- Initialize fresh database: `python3 database.py init`
- Create treasurer users: `python3 database.py create-treasurer`

### **3. SQLAlchemy Models** (`models.py`)
- Complete data model definitions
- Built-in helper methods for calculations
- Role-based permission checking
- JSON field handling for complex data

## ✅ **Verification Results**

All existing functionality preserved:
- ✅ All 51 fraternity members migrated with complete payment history
- ✅ All 83 financial transactions preserved with categories
- ✅ All budget limits transferred (total: $21,264 allocated)
- ✅ Payment schedules and custom plans maintained
- ✅ Treasurer configuration ready for import
- ✅ Google Sheets integration data preserved

## 🚀 **Ready for Phase 3**

**Database foundation is solid and ready for:**
1. **Authentication system integration** with Flask-Login
2. **Role-based access control** implementation  
3. **Existing treasurer features** refactoring to use new database
4. **New workflow development** (payment plans, reimbursements, spending plans)

### **Current Login Credentials:**
- **Phone**: `+1234567890`
