## 💡 Tips for Success

### Free vs Paid Hosting
- **Free Replit**: Perfect for most fraternities
  - App "sleeps" after 30 minutes of inactivity
  - Wakes up in ~10 seconds when accessed
  - Great for budget-conscious organizations

- **Always On ($5/month)**: For active fraternities
  - 24/7 uptime, no sleeping
  - Faster response times
  - Custom domain support

### Making It Professional
1. **Custom Domain**: Point `yourfrat.com` to your Repl
2. **Branding**: Upload your fraternity logo to `static/images/`
3. **Colors**: Customize `static/css/enhanced-ui.css`

### Data Management
- Your data is automatically saved in Replit
- **Export monthly** for backups using built-in export feature
- Use Google Sheets integration for additional backup
