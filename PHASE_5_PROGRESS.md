## ðŸ“Š Current System Status

### Fully Operational Systems:
1. âœ… **Authentication & RBAC** - Multi-role access control
2. âœ… **Reimbursement Requests** - Complete expense workflow
3. âœ… **Spending Plans** - Semester budget planning system
4. âœ… **Payment Suggestions** - Brother-initiated payment modifications
5. âœ… **Role-Based Dashboards** - Personalized interfaces

### System Routes Available:
- **Authentication**: `/login`, `/register`, `/admin/users/*`
- **Dashboards**: `/dashboard/*` (role-specific routing)
- **Reimbursements**: `/reimbursements/*` (complete CRUD + approval)
- **Spending Plans**: `/spending-plans/*` (creation + approval workflow)
- **Payment Suggestions**: `/payment-suggestions/*` (negotiation system)

## ðŸš€ Remaining Phase 5 Tasks

### 3. Advanced Reporting & Analytics Dashboard
Still pending implementation:
